Hello! I am Janhavi (jaan-huh-vee), I recently graduated from the Masters in Computer Science program at Rice University, set to graduate December 2024. Prior to my Masters, I was working as a Solutions Engineer for 2 years at Symbl.ai, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) company. 

The focus of my Masters has been deep learning foundation models with a minor in high performance computing. I am a generalist, and have hands-on experience with all types of models from statistical machine learning models to graphical, multi-modal models and reinforcement learning. I've had the opportunity to implement my learnings in industry projects for CNPC (Materials R&D), NASA (Hardware-constrained spacecrafts) and in Kaggle Competitions. 

Apart from this, I also take a keen interest in leadership & sharing nuggets of my Indian culture. I served as the President of a graduate student club, "Indian Students at Rice", where I led a team of 10 in organizing diverse cultural events which see an attendance between 100 to 700 people, depending on the occasion. 

I aspire to bring curiosity, thoughtfulness and integrity to all the teams I work on. I am looking for full-time opportunities in the ML/DL space starting end of February 2025.
