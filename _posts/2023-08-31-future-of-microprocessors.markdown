## Paper Summary

This paper, written in 2011, provides predictions and suggestions for which methods of microprocessor scaling will provide maximum benefit in the future. To do this, they first review the impact of 3 major methods - transistor-speed scaling, core micro-architecture techniques and cache memories to determine which of them were more beneficial, and then analyse the current trends to determine the future potential of those methods. To conclude, the authors explain the reasons why multi-core processors and customised hardware are likely to be the next major drivers of growth whilst also pointing the limitations of the techniques to give an estimate of their impact. 

## Strengths

* The authors provide supporting data and visualisations to back their claims and drive their point quite well.

## Weaknesses

* Although the paper briefly touches upon software trends as a driving force of change, they do not analyse the ongoing trends in popular applications to identify which of them would drive the microprocessor business/market in the near future e.g. graphics heavy applications, data-heavy applications.

## Problems / Open Issues

* As pointed out in the conclusion, there are several new scaling regimes such as research in new materials, quantum electronics that are likely to be game-changers but too new for us to reasonably predict anything about them.
